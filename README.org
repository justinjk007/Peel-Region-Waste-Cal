* Setup

Make a new virtual environment and Install requirements, requires python 2.7

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

deactivate # To deactivate environment after use
#+END_SRC

To run the server
#+begin_src sh
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
#+end_src

Import the =Waste disposal calendar.ics= into your calendar. I suggest
creating new calendar anywhere because loaded file cannot be unloaded.
